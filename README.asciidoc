VAF - Visual Analytics Framework
================================
A framework for the interactive and visual exploration of data.

At the moment, can be built only on Windows, using the waf build
sytem with the MinGW environment (g++). Support for Linux and
building with Visual Studio solutions is available for older versions,
but have not been kept up to date due to time constraints.

Requirements to build:
- MinGW, with g++ 4.6 or better
- Python 2.5 or better ( for the build system, waf )
- git version control

To build, run the following commands inside the project's root folder:
`python waf configure`
`python waf`

To run the unit tests:
`python waf --check=1`
